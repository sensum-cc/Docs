## :material-head-question-outline: What is Sensum?

Sensum is fully websided multibotting service for Growtopia, formely known as Plutonium. We offer website interface to control
your bots from anywhere any time with any device.

## :octicons-gear-16: How it works?

You don't have to download anything or have your own servers vps (commonly referred as RDP). You can control everything from our website using any device equipped with the latest modern browser featuresâ€”be it a PC, laptop, phone, or even your Samsung smart fridge. The bots continue running seamlessly, persisting beyond the closure of the web page, browser, or device shutdown. Operating in nodes that predominantly function 24/7, they only experience downtime in case of issues or when a new update needs be applied. However, downtime is typically brief, and alternative nodes remain active. Long-term run nodes, while subject to intermittent downtime for critical updates, offer minimal disruption and are ideal for those prioritizing zero downtime bots.

## :fontawesome-solid-money-check-dollar: Subscription Model

Sensum operates on a Pay-as-You-Go model. Deposit a balance to your account through your chosen payment method, and the balance decreases based on your botting usage. If you dont have any bots allocated to node you dont lose any balance. You can view prices from our discord server

## :simple-moneygram: What if i had lifetime or balance in old sensum/plutonium

If you auth to sensum with same discord account what you used to plutonium & older sensum site your balance will be added back any ongoing monthly subscriptions will be turned back to balance too. If you had lifetime on plutonium you will get 25$ added to your balance.

## :material-server: Different Node types

### Normal
- Normal node is node what receives normally updates but doens't have lua enabled
### LT
- LT (Long Term) Node is node what receives updates only if theyre critical but still gets feature updates usually when gt is under long maintenance this node is best to maximise your bots uptime it doesnt have lua enabled
### Lua
- Lua means simply Node has lua enabled. This can cause node to be unstable as some scripts can cause node to possibly crash or get short mem leaks until node detects bad script running.

    Nodes can be mixed so there can be node's with Lua + LT
